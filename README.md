# front-end-dev-book

This is a tutorial project which is used by the <front-end-dev-book>, so each chapter add new feature to the project. I want to record the changing process of the project.

So I create this repository to record the changes along with the book.

When I believe that the change is big enough, i will create a new branch for that chapter, which will not be merged to the master branch.

Because I want to compare all the difference between branches.

## chapter 1~3 is finished

So i create a new branch for chapter 4.
